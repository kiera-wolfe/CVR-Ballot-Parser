# SDP-project

## Requirement

This product assumes that a working browser is installed.

This product uses Python. To install Python, follow the official guide for Python
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

This product uses Bokeh and other libraries to display the graphical elements. To install Bokeh, one can use `pip` by
typing the following line in the terminal (command line).

```bash
pip install --user bokeh
```

Alternatively, one can follow the guidelines in the official guide for Bokeh
[here](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/quickstart.html#userguide-quickstart-install).

To install Pandas use `pip` by typing the following line in the terminal (command line).

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Running

### Using the Batch File

Step 1. Copy and paste or move the CVR file that you wish to read into the **_CVR Folder_**.
        Copy the name of the file you have moved as it will be needed in the next step.
        
Step 2. Open the **_config.yaml_** file in any basic text editor.
        Copy the CVR filename used in Step 1 in the _location_ section as in the example below.
        Be sure to include the quotations around the filename.
        
```bash        
location: "ExampleCVR.csv"
```

Step 3. Edit each line as necessary according to the CVR file used and the desired output.
        
Step 4. Run the **_View CVR Results_** batch file.
        Execute this batch file by double clicking.
        A press enter after verifying Step 1 and 2 are completed.


### Running on Command Line

Follow Steps 1 and 2 above prior to using the command line.

To run the product, one can type the following line in the terminal.

```bash
bokeh serve --show display.py
```

This will create a (private) Bokeh server (listening to port 5006), and open a browser tab showing
the graph.

Subsequently, one can also type `http://localhost:5006` in the browser to see and interact with
the same graph.

When finished, one can press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the server.

### Advanced

When multiple server sessions are required (e.g., when multiple auditors are reviewing different
part of the same dataset), each reviewer should decide a unique port number `PORT` between 1000
and 65535, and type the following line in the terminal.

```bash
bokeh serve --port PORT --show display.py
```

For example, if a reviewer uses `5007` as the port number, then they should type `bokeh serve
--port 5007 --show display`.

## Interactions

The plot shows the votes of a single ballot, when the "Ballot" selection is not set to "all", and
shows the summary of an entire batch of ballots otherwise.

One can click on the drop-down menus and select different choices to inspect different individual
ballots or to check the overview of a batch of ballots.
